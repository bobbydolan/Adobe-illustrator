# Ai Scripts

My collection of Ai JSX scripts I use day-to-day

## Installation

Copy the contents of this folder to `Adobe Illustrator/Presets/EN_US/Scripting/`

Replace `EN_US` with whatever language you are using.

## Ai Sessions

This script will save a list of currently open documents to a small JSON file in your home directory. You can re-open the same collection of files any time by running the script and choesing the Session date from the list. Only the 10 most recent sessions are saved.

### Usage:

1. Navigate to `File / Scripts / Ai Sessions`
2. Click `Save` to save the current session
3. To return to a session navigate to `File / Scripts / Ai Sessions`
4. Select the desired session date from the list

## Batch Resize Artboards

This script will resize all artboards in all documents in a folder (such as a folder of SVG files).

### Usage

1. Navigate to `File / Scripts / Batch Resize Artboards`
2. When prompted, select the desired folder of files to resize
3. When prompted, enter an integer value for the width/height of the new artboards.


## Contact Sheet

This script creates a contact sheet from a source folder of SVG files. For more details see https://github.com/iconfinder/scripts-for-icondesigners/tree/master/icon-contact-sheet

## Merge SVG Docs

This script will merge a folder of SVG files into a single document. Each SVG file will be placed on its own artboard. The artboard name will match the file name minus the file extension.

Since Illustrator is currently limited to 100 artboards per file, the script can only accommodate 100 files max. If you have more than 100 files, split them into multiple folders.

### Usage

1. Navigate to `File / Scripts / Merge SVG Docs`
2. When prompted, select the desired folder of files to merge

## MoveItemsToNearestPixel

This script will move all items in an illustrator file to the nearest pixel.

### Usage

1. With an open Illustrator document
2. Navigate to `File / Scripts / MoveItemsToNearestPixel`

## MultiExporter

Exports all groups or layers in an Illustrator document to individual SVG or PDF files.
